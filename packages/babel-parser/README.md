# brasa-parser

> A Brasa parser. A fork of babel for portuguese.

This is a fork of @babel/parser that modifies it just enough to recognize 
javascript keywords in portuguese. This way the AST is correctly built from 
brasa code, but in the end normal javascript will be output.

brasa-parser is just a proof of concept for now.
